🧩 Problem 1: Sum of All Elements
Method Header
public static int sum2D(int[][] matrix)
Task
Write a method that returns the sum of all even elements in a 2D integer array.
Example
If matrix contains:
1  2  3
4  5  6
The method should return 12.

🧩 Problem 2: Row Average
Method Header
public static double rowAverage(int[][] matrix, int row)
Task
Return the average of the elements in a given row.
Assume:
row is a valid index
The row contains at least one element
Example
For row 1 in:
2  4
6  8
Return 7.0.

🧩 Problem 3: Count Occurrences
Method Header
public static int countValue(int[][] matrix, int target)
Task
Count how many times target appears in the 2D array.
Example
Target = 3
3  1  3
2  3  4
Return 3.

🧩 Problem 4: Column Maximum
Method Header
public static int columnMax(int[][] matrix, int col)
Task
Return the largest value in a given column.
Assume:
col is a valid index
The matrix has at least one row
Example
Column 0 in:
5  2  9
7  1  4

Return 7.

🧩 Problem 5: Difference of All Elements of two 2d arrays of integers
Method Header
public static int[][] diff2D(int[][] matrix1, int[][] matrix2)
Task
Write a method that returns the difference of all elements and returns the answer in a 2D integer array.
